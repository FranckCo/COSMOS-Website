				<h1 id="cosmos-2024---call-for-contributions">COSMOS 2024 - Call for
					Contributions</h1>
				<p><a href="https://www.insee.fr/en/">Insee</a> is pleased to invite the
					statistical community to submit contributions for the first Conference
					On Smart Metadata for Official Statistics 2024 (COSMOS 2024), to be held
					on 11-12 April 2024 in Paris, France.</p>
				<p>Conference web page: <a href="http://cosmos-conference.org/2024">http://cosmos-conference.org/2024</a>.</p>
				<h2 id="context">Context</h2>
				<p>The world of data is changing. Official statistics organizations need
					to find, acquire and integrate data from both traditional and new data
					sources at an ever-increasing pace, while maintaining the usability and
					quality of outputs. Data cycles are shorter, and AI and ML continue to
					accelerate the need for data.</p>
				<p>In this context, the demand for metadata is also changing. Metadata
					now needs to support <a href="https://www.go-fair.org/">FAIR</a>, the Open Science
					vision and other initiatives that require transparency, reproducibility
					and data that is not only easy to find and use, but also comparable and
					interoperable across domains. To this end, we need <a href="../manifesto.html">“smart” metadata</a> that
					is standard, machine-actionable, capable of enhancing data quality and
					usability, and rich enough to drive the statistical process.</p>
				<p>Smart metadata and AI technologies can benefit from each other:
					metadata can enable better AI capabilities, but AI also be applied to
					create and manage better metadata.</p>
				<h2 id="conference-objectives">Conference Objectives</h2>
				<p>The COSMOS conference is a place where the official statistics
					community can work together to define, share, use, and manage smart
					metadata. Through sharing of experiences, techniques, and tools, and
					through forward-looking consideration of the challenges we face as a
					community, we can better meet the demands of the modern data landscape.
					We encourage official statisticians, metadata experts, data managers,
					and those involved in the collection, production, and dissemination of
					statistics to attend.</p>
				<p>COSMOS will emphasize the ways in which statistical organizations can
					implement smart metadata in their institute, covering areas such as:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Standards</li>
					<li>Business use cases</li>
					<li>Governance</li>
					<li>Best practices definition</li>
					<li>Tools and implementation systems experiences (lessons learned,
						difficulties encountered, key successes)
					</li>
				</ul>
				<p>This will be the first of a series of conferences, focusing on the
					best way forward in the development and use of smart metadata in all its
					forms.</p>
				<h2 id="topics-of-interest">Topics of Interest</h2>
				<p>Topics of interest include, but not limited to:</p>
				<h3 id="metadata-standards">Metadata standards</h3>
				<ul>
					<li>Lessons learned about implementing standards in your
						organization
					</li>
					<li>Any of your own ontologies created for supporting other needs</li>
					<li>Tools used or developed for supporting standards</li>
					<li>Best practices defined</li>
					<li>Interoperability issues between standards</li>
					<li>How to reconcile the conceptual and implementation models?</li>
					<li>How do you define core metadata for your organisation?</li>
					<li>How do you manage metadata (any burden issue?)?</li>
					<li>Governance</li>
					<li>Sharing knowledge about standards in the community</li>
					<li>Feedback: when do you decide to track changes (versioning)?</li>
					<li>How far should we go in terms of traceability? / How far do we
						version?
					</li>
					<li>Any experience about provenance and lineage models and
						implementations
					</li>
					<li>How to collect various kinds of metadata and standardise them for
						statistical use?
					</li>
				</ul>
				<h3 id="linking">Linking</h3>
				<ul>
					<li>How can data and metadata concepts be linked?</li>
					<li>Linking with geospatial representations</li>
					<li>What are the existing tools?</li>
					<li>How do we establish, document and share best practices?</li>
					<li>How can we perform data reconciliation, ontology matching and
						instance matching with statistical data?
					</li>
					<li>Linking codes and concepts between institutes</li>
				</ul>
				<h3 id="active-metadata">Active metadata</h3>
				<p>The use of metadata can extend beyond their function of describing
					and helping to understand data. Based on machine-actionable semantically
					rich standard, metadata can automatically generate components of the
					statistical process and/or trigger their executions. They take on a new
					role to some extent, no longer simply “information to facilitate
					understanding of statistics” but becoming “data used in the statistical
					business process”; hence the notion of active metadata.</p>
				<p>Active metadata can serve as an important resource for data
					management and security, determining quality, providing appropriate
					access, personalizing delivery of data, and developing flexible
					“self-serve” systems for better meeting users’ needs.</p>
				<p>Experiences of early or mature implementations are welcomed.</p>
				<h3 id="fair">FAIR</h3>
				<p>FAIR data meet the principles of findability, accessibility,
					interoperability, and reusability.</p>
				<ul>
					<li>How to assess the compliance FAIR principles?</li>
					<li>How to implement FAIR principles in an organization?</li>
					<li>What are FAIR and transparent metadata for confidential data that are
					shared under restrictions?</li>
					<li>What role do smart metadata play in providing access to protected data?</li>
					<li>What does “reusable” mean for statistical data?</li>
					<li>How does provenance metadata help in being FAIR?</li>
				</ul>
