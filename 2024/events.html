          DDI representation of variables in repetitive contexts
        </h2>
        <p class="text">
          The goal of this workshop is to study the representation of variables
          in DDI Lifecycle, specifically in iterative contexts: panels, cohorts,
          repeated surveys, periodic administrative files, etc. Beyond the
          representation of variables, the work will also cover their
          organization into schemes and resource packages, and their
          relationships with other objects such as study units, physical
          instances, code lists, managed representations, etc.
        </p>
        <p class="text">
          The work will produce harmonized descriptions of use cases coming from
          different business contexts, guidelines on how to use DDI-L constructs
          for repetitive contexts, what more could be needed, etc. Detailed
          documentation is available on a
          <a href="https://github.com/Making-Sense-Info/Varese/"

          SDMX, DDI and related standards for statistical production: making
          interoperability work
        </h2>
        <p class="text">
          SDMX and the DDI standards were developed in parallel and
          independently. Each started within its own user community, and have
          evolved significantly over the years gaining a lot of overlap.
          However, there persists some misconceptions, and one is that SDMX and
          DDI standards compete. We hold a different view – the standards
          address similar things in different ways and “levels”. The differences
          are complementary rather than in conflict and it’s increasingly
          important to uncover how SDMX and DDI standards can and should work
          together. Some progress has been made over the past year in that
          direction, understanding how each of them complies with GSBPM. Now is
          time to analyze both standards vis-à-vis.
        </p>
        <p class="text">
          In addition, data and metadata used and produced in the statistical
          business process need to be validated and transformed, and that’s
          where standard languages like VTL and SDTL come into play. They have
          been born within SDMX and DDI, respectively, but both were conceived
          as "agnostic" to the data and metadata models to be processed. So, can
          these languages interoperate in such contexts?
        </p>
        <p class="text">
          Statistics producers gain to benefit by understanding how all these
          standards interact and how to use them together to automate production
          pipelines and improve interoperability in a cost-effective way. This
          meeting prior to COSMOS is devoted to making progress in this area.

          DDI Alliance Questionnaires / Question Working Group
        </h2>
        <p class="text">
          In 2014, DDI Lifecycle 3.2 introduced a robust schema for managing and
          documenting full questionnaires, further improvements were added in
          DDI-L 3.3 such as the ability to support measurements. Since then,
          many organisations have adopted the standard and started implementing
          questionnaire and question documentation as an integral part of
          capturing the data lifecycle. The development of software tools has
          built up substantial community knowledge about the strengths and
          weaknesses of the current version of the DDI-Lifecycle standard.
        </p>
        <p class="text">
          A preliminary workshop was held at EDDI 2022 and suggested that the
          formation of a DDI Alliance Working Group would be helpful to
          co-ordinate further development activities. The initial scope of the
          Working groups was to:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Develop best practice for implementation</li>
          <li>Develop best practice for interchange</li>
          <li>
            Provide ideas for revisions, extensions, and feed into future
            versions of DDI
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p class="text">
          The meeting will be an opportunity to review these, suggest further
          areas, and create a terms of reference for proposing the establishment
          of a formal Working Group.
